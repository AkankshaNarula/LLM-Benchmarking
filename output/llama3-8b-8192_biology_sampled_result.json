We need to calculate the number of individuals with O, A, B, and AB type blood.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of individuals with each genotype:\n\n* AA: 0.95^2 = 0.9025\n* AO: 2 * 0.95 * 0.01 = 0.019\n* OO: 0.01^2 = 0.0001\n* BB: 0.04^2 = 0.0016\n* BO: 2 * 0.04 * 0.01 = 0.0008\n* AB: 2 * 0.95 * 0.04 = 0.038\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of individuals with each blood type:\n\n* O: OO + BO = 0.0001 + 0.0008 = 0.0009\n* A: AA + AO = 0.9025 + 0.019 = 0.9215\n* B: BB + BO = 0.0016 + 0.0008 = 0.0024\n* AB: AB = 0.038\n\nSince the total population is 424, we can multiply the number of individuals with each blood type by 424 to get the actual number of individuals:\n\n* O: 0.0009 * 424 = 3.828\n* A: 0.9215 * 424 = 391.5\n* B: 0.0024 * 424 = 1.016\n* AB: 0.038 * 424 = 16.112\n\nRounding the numbers to the nearest whole number, we get:\n\n* O: 4\n* A: 391\n* B: 16\n* AB: 16\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nE.

However, if the head is cut off, no metamorphosis takes place, even though the larva continues to live.\n\nThis suggests that the head is playing a crucial role in the process of metamorphosis, even though the hormone is secreted by the gland in the thorax.\n\nThe correct answer is A. The gland in the thorax is the only gland involved, but it requires a signal from the head to start metamorphosis.\n\nThis makes sense because the head likely contains a receptor or a signaling molecule that is necessary for the hormone secreted by the gland in the thorax to trigger metamorphosis. Without the head, the hormone cannot initiate the metamorphic process, even though it is still being produced.\n\nThe other options do not accurately describe the situation. For example, option B suggests that the gland in the head is necessary for metamorphosis, which is not supported by the evidence. Option D suggests that the head must be present to activate the hormone, but this is not necessary if the hormone is already being produced."

This limited ability to absorb resources and transport them to the rest of the plant restricts their growth to a certain height, typically less than 15 cm."

The blood flow throughout the body is caused by the pressure difference that drives the blood through the vessel and the vascular resistance.

This is known as the \"pressure-flow relationship\".\n* The blood flow is slowest in the capillaries because they have a much greater total cross-sectional area compared to the other blood vessels. This means that the blood has to flow through a much larger surface area, which slows down the flow rate.\n* The other options are incorrect because:\n\t+ A is incorrect because the volume of the blood vessels does not directly affect blood flow.\n\t+ B is incorrect because the expansion and contraction of blood vessels does not directly affect blood flow, and the pulmonary arteries do not have the thickest walls.\n\t+ C is incorrect because blood flow is not slowest in the arteries due to their smaller size.\n\t+ D is incorrect because osmotic pressure differences do not directly affect blood flow, and the aorta does not have high blood pressure.\n\t+ E is incorrect because the contraction of muscles around veins does not directly affect blood flow, and arterioles do not have high resistance.\n\t+ F is incorrect because gravitational pull does not directly affect blood flow.\n\t+ G is incorrect because the heart pumping blood is the primary driver of blood flow, but it does not directly affect the flow rate in the capillaries.\n\t+ H is incorrect because the rhythmic contractions of the diaphragm do not directly affect blood flow.\n\t+ J is incorrect because electrical impulses do not directly affect blood flow, and large veins do not have capacitance.\n\nThe answer is I."

Water is necessary for many cellular processes, including metabolism and transport of nutrients.\n\nPhototrophs and chemotrophs are both types of organisms that obtain their energy from their environment. Phototrophs, such as plants and algae, obtain their energy from sunlight, while chemotrophs, such as bacteria and archaea, obtain their energy from chemical reactions. Both types of organisms require a source of energy, a carbon source, a nitrogen source, and other nutrients for growth.\n\nAutotrophs are organisms that produce their own food through photosynthesis or chemosynthesis, while heterotrophs are organisms that obtain their energy by consuming other organisms or organic matter.

The resulting lysate is divided into two parts.\n3. Half of the lysate is diluted 1:10^7 and plated onto a lawn of E. coli strain B. This means that each plaque on this plate represents a single phage particle that can infect and lyse E. coli strain B.\n4. There are 40 plaques on this plate, which means that 40 phage particles can infect and lyse E. coli strain B.\n5. The other half of the lysate is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on E. coli strain K. This means that each plaque on this plate represents a single phage particle that can infect and lyse E. coli strain K.\n6. There are 4 plaques on this plate, which means that 4 phage particles can infect and lyse E. coli strain K.\n\nNow, let's think about the recombination between the two mutations in the T4 genome. When two phage particles infect the same bacterium, they can exchange genetic material and recombine. The frequency of recombination is proportional to the distance between the two mutations.\n\nIn this case, the frequency of recombination is the ratio of the number of plaques on the K plate (4) to the total number of plaques on the B plate (40). This ratio is 4/40 = 0.1, or 10%.\n\nHowever, this is not the correct answer because the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations, not the frequency of recombination. The amount of recombination is the distance between the two mutations, which is proportional to the frequency of recombination.\n\nTo find the amount of recombination, we need to convert the frequency of recombination from a ratio to a percentage. To do this, we multiply the frequency by 100:\n\n0.1 x 100 = 10%\n\nHowever, this is not the correct answer because the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations, not the frequency of recombination.

So, the ratio [(T + C) / (A + G)] will also be 0.3.\n\n(b) The ratio for the entire molecule:\n\nThe entire molecule consists of two complementary strands. The ratio [(A + G) / (T + C)] is 0.3 for one strand, and the ratio [(T + C) / (A + G)] is also 0.3 for the other strand. To find the ratio for the entire molecule, we can take the average of these two ratios:\n\n[(A + G) / (T + C)] + [(T + C) / (A + G)] = 0.3 + 0.3 = 0.6\n\nSo, the ratio for the entire molecule is 0.6.\n\n(c) If the [(A + T) / (C + G)] ratio is 0.3, what is the ratio in the complementary strand and in the entire molecule?\n\nSince the ratio [(A + T) / (C + G)] is 0.3, it means that the number of A and T nucleotides is 30% of the total number of nucleotides. The complementary strand will have the same ratio, but with C and G nucleotides instead of A and T. So, the ratio [(C + G) / (A + T)] will also be 0.3.\n\nThe ratio for the entire molecule will be the average of these two ratios:\n\n[(A + T) / (C + G)] + [(C + G) / (A + T)] = 0.3 + 0.3 = 0.6\n\nSo, the ratio for the entire molecule is 0.6.\n\nThe correct answer is (B) 3.0, 0.5, 3.0."
